# Character Controller:

A component(s) attached to our gameobject that allows us to handle

1. movement
2. collisions

## Aspects of a character controller

* character movement
* collision detection
* uneven ground
* slopes
* ground

## Types of character controller

* unity built-in character controller
* rigidbody character controller

## RigidBody Character Controller:

Two types for this controller

1. Dynamic
	* Dynamic Rigidbody follows the laws of unity's physics engine
2. Kinematic
	* Kinematic Rigidbody will not be affected from forces, collisions and joints.
	* You have complete control on how these factors will affect your character through scripting.

## Project Choice

In this project we will be using a dynamic rigidbody character controller made from scratch.
